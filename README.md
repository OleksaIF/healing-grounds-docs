# 🌱 Healing Grounds – Game Design Concept

This repository contains example game documentation created as part of my self-study journey in Game Design and QA. These documents represent early planning for a future game project titled **Healing Grounds** – a peaceful, environmentally themed exploration game with light mechanics and narrative focus.

## 📘 Included:

- **GDD** – Game Design Document with systems, mechanics, and vision  
- **LDD** – Level Design Document with layout, goals, and pacing structure  

## 👨‍💻 About Me:

I'm Oleksii Anushkevychus – an aspiring Game QA Tester and Game Design enthusiast. I created these documents to learn how to properly plan and structure a game project, and to demonstrate my skills in systems thinking, technical writing, and creative vision.

This is not a completed game, but an example of design preparation and learning.
